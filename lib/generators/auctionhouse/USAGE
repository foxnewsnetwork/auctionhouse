Description:
    A big macro for generating out a (currently simple) item-auction platform.
    The current functionality is highly limited because I am still building it,
    but eventually expect it to generate an ebay-like service with 1 command.

Example:
    rails generate auctionhouse Item

    This will create:
        app/controllers/items_controller.rb
        app/controllers/item_bids_controller.rb
        app/model/item.rb
        app/model/item_bid.rb
        db/migrate/auctionhouse_create_item.rb
    
    This will modify:
    		config/routes.rb
